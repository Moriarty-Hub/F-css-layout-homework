          "From what little evidence we have about China's troll-farm activity, with its bots and with all of its others, they seem to be favoring Vice President Biden, trying trying to make life very difficult for President Trump â€” as well as fueling the protests, of course," Chang stated. "I think that Beijing has decided that it's voting for the Democratic Party candidate."
          It was not immediately clear where Chang's information comes from but the US government and Silicon Valley have not offered any public assessment about alleged covert Chinese troll farm activity similar to what he described. Chang did not respond to CNN's request for comment regarding the origins of the information he cited.
